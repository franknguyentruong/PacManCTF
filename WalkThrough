	Essential commands
Here is a summary of basic commands for navigating the command line:

ls lists the contents of the folder (directory) you’re currently in:
ls
pwd stands for ‘print working directory’ and tells you what directory you are currently in:
pwd
cd stands for ‘change directory’ and navigates to the directory you want to move into:
cd directoryname/
cd .. navigates up one directory, meaning it moves you from a subfolder into its parent folder:
cd ..
Additional commands
These are useful for creating and removing directories and files.

mkdir stands for ‘make directory’ and creates a new directory in the directory you are currently in:
mkdir directoryname/
cp is followed by the name of the file to copy and then the directory you want it copied into:
cp filename.filetype path/to/directory
rm stands for ‘remove’ and deletes files (careful with this one, you cannot undo it):
rm filename.filetype
